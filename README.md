The World is a book， and those who do not travel read only a page.
Your life does not get better by chance,it gets better by change. 
Look at the man with time and heart, not with your eyes.
Sometimes the best things in life happen against the odds. 
The only way to meet the right one is to be what you really are.
To believe , each day the sun will not live up to their own smile.
All that you do, do with your might; things done by halves are never done right.
You don’t need to look up to others, for you yourself are a spectacle. 
Be strong, be true, be forever ‘who you are’.
